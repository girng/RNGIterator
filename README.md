# RNGIterator

Calculates the amount of iterations needed for a chance to be true in [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/).

Iterations can help a developer when brainstorming and implementing certain game mechanics. Some examples: what to do after a monster was killed, the chance of an item applying a modifier based on chance on another item, on kill chances, on hit chances, chance for an item to drop, chance of an entity appearing in a generated map, etc. The developer having a general estimate of how many iterations are required for certain things can be very powerful. The closer we get to understanding randomess, the better our lives will become. I hope this helps!
